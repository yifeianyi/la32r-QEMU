- Introduction

  LoongArch is the general processor architecture of Loongson.

  The following versions of the LoongArch core are supported
    core: 3A5000
    https://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation/releases/download/2021.08.17/LoongArch-Vol1-v1.00-EN.pdf

  We can get the latest loongarch documents at https://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation/tags.


- Linux-user emulation

  We already support Linux user emulation. We can use LoongArch cross-tools to build LoongArch executables on X86 machines,
  and We can also use qemu-loongarch64 to run LoongArch executables.

  1. Install LoongArch cross-tools on X86 machines.

    Download cross-tools.

      wget https://github.com/loongson/build-tools/releases/latest/download/loongarch64-clfs-20211202-cross-tools.tar.xz

      tar -vxf loongarch64-clfs-20211202-cross-tools.tar.xz -C /opt

    Config cross-tools env.

      . setenv.sh

      setenv.sh:

          #!/bin/sh
          set -x
          CC_PREFIX=/opt/cross-tools

          export PATH=$CC_PREFIX/bin:$PATH
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CC_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CC_PREFIX/loongarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          set +x

  2. Test tests/tcg/multiarch.

    ./configure --disable-rdma --disable-pvrdma --prefix=/usr  \
            --target-list="loongarch64-linux-user"  \
            --disable-libiscsi --disable-libnfs --disable-libpmem \
            --disable-glusterfs --enable-libusb --enable-usb-redir \
            --disable-opengl --disable-xen --enable-spice --disable-werror \
            --enable-debug --disable-capstone --disable-kvm --enable-profiler

    cd  build/

    make && make check-tcg

  3. Run LoongArch system basic command with loongarch-clfs-system.

    Download clfs-system.

      wget https://github.com/loongson/build-tools/releases/latest/download/loongarch64-clfs-system-2021-12-02.tar.bz2

      tar -vxf loongarch64-clfs-system-2021-12-02.tar.bz2 -C /opt/clfs

    Config env.

      cp /opt/clfs/lib64/ld-linux-loongarch64.so.1   /lib64

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/clfs/lib64"

    Run LoongArch system basic command.

      ./qemu-loongarch64  /opt/clfs/usr/bin/bash
      ./qemu-loongarch64  /opt/clfs/usr/bin/ls
      ./qemu-loongarch64  /opt/clfs/usr/bin/pwd
      ...

- System emulation

  Mainly emulate a virt 3A5000 board and ls7a bridge that is not exactly the same as the host.
  3A5000 support multiple interrupt cascading while here we just emulate the extioi interrupt
  cascading. LS7A1000 host bridge support multiple devices, such as sata, gmac, uart, rtc
  and so on. But we just realize the rtc. Others use the qemu common devices. It does not affect
  the general use. We also introduced the emulation of devices at docs/system/loongarch/loongson3.rst.

  You can compile the binaries by youself or just get all required binaries from the github for testing.

  1.Download kernel and the cross-tools.(vmlinux)

      https://github.com/loongson/linux/tree/loongarch-next
      https://github.com/loongson/build-tools/releases/latest/download/loongarch64-clfs-20211202-cross-tools.tar.xz

  2.Download uefi code.(loongarch_bios.bin)

      https://github.com/loongson/edk2/tree/LoongArch
      https://github.com/loongson/edk2-platforms

  3.Download the clfs-system and make a ramdisk with busybox.(ramdisk)

  4.Run with command,eg:

   ./build/qemu-system-loongarch64 -m 4G -smp 4 --cpu Loongson-3A5000 --machine loongson3-ls7a -kernel ./vmlinux -initrd ./ramdisk  -append "root=/dev/ram console=ttyS0,115200 rdinit=/sbin/init loglevel=8" -monitor tcp::4000,server,nowait -nographic

All binaries can get from here directly:
    git clone https://github.com/yangxiaojuan-loongson/qemu-binary
